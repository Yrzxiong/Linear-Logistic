# Linear-Logistic

You will be given two datasets.  Both of these are classic datasets.  The first one is an auto MPG dataset where I would like to predict the mpg based on the other features.  

The second dataset is a telelcom dataset where you have to predict whether the customer is going to churn (leave the telecom company) or not

Linear: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG (and attached csv file)

Logistic: This is attached

Required: You will be turning in two files LastName_FirstName_Midterm_Logistic/Linear

Please use Pandas and any Data Viz Libraries at your disposal. I would like to see a full data science project to an extent.  Obviously we are on a short timeframe here but graphs/charts showing the distribution of the data and how the features interact with each other.  I would expect a fully mature model.  Part of the grading will be based on your methodology and your results.
